## Overview

This repository contains the supplementary materials for the paper, "From Measurement to Understanding: An Architecture of Emulated Expertise for LLM-Diagnostics in Education." These materials provide the complete conceptual blueprint, methodological rationale, and validation protocols for a new generation of diagnostic systems designed to ensure methodological validity in high-stakes educational contexts using Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Abstract:** The demand for developmental diagnostics in personalized education reveals a fundamental crisis in classical psychometrics. In response, this paper presents a conceptual blueprint for a new generation of diagnostic systems, engineered to ensure methodological validity in high-stakes contexts by leveraging large language models (LLMs). The project is grounded in five core principles: methodological grounding (evidence-centered design), a hybrid 'centaur' architecture, echeloned quality control, role-oriented utility, and data sovereignty. The core innovation is an 'emulated expertise architecture' that emulates not the expert's consciousness but their idealized professional workflow. It decomposes the act of judgment into a network of verifiable procedures - including systematic falsification, independent peer review (supervision), and dialectical synthesis - executed by a multi-agent system of functionally specialized 'prompt archetypes' ('researcher', 'auditor', 'communicator'). The entire process is governed by the 'human-over-the-loop' (HOTL) ethical imperative, positioning the system as a tool for expert augmentation. This approach facilitates a paradigm shift from a 'psychometrics of measurement' to a 'psychometrics of understanding,' generating not merely a score, but a dynamic, contextualized model of a learner's cognitive processes.

## Core Innovation: The Emulated Expertise Architecture

The central innovation is an architecture that emulates an idealized, rigorous, and transparent professional workflow rather than attempting to replicate the opaque consciousness of a human expert. This is achieved through a multi-agent system of functionally specialized **prompt archetypes**:

*   **The 'Researcher'**: The core diagnostic engine. It analyzes textual data to generate and critically test multiple competing hypotheses about a user's cognitive and personality patterns, using dialectical methods (thesis-antithesis-synthesis) to arrive at the most robust explanation.
*   **The 'Auditor'**: The quality control unit. It performs an independent, multi-tiered verification of the 'Researcher's' work, auditing everything from the evidence base and logical consistency to methodological congruence, ensuring the final output is sound and defensible.
*   **The 'Communicator'**: The user-facing adaptation layer. It translates the dense, professional report from the 'Researcher' into an accessible, ethically-grounded, and pedagogically valuable format for the end-user, ensuring clarity and promoting self-reflection.

## Repository Contents: A Guide to the Supplementary Materials

This repository provides the full text of the supplementary materials, which detail the conceptual and methodological foundations of the system. The document is structured to provide a complete, multi-layered account of the project’s design.

**Please note:** The scope of this disclosure is limited to conceptual and methodological specifications. Environment-specific engineering assets (e.g., full prompt libraries, orchestration logic, runtime configurations) are implementation-dependent and fall outside the scope of these materials.

### Section S0: Methodology for Translating Psychometric Instruments into Behavioral Analysis Protocols
Details the core, five-phase R&D process for translating any introspective psychometric instrument into a valid, text-based behavioral analysis protocol. This is the foundation that ensures the system's methodological grounding.

### Section S1: Microarchitecture of the ‘Prompt Researcher’
Provides a complete specification of the ‘Researcher’ archetype, including its heuristic core for hypothesis generation, the sub-process for reflective self-audit (confidence score calculation), and the finalization process for generating consistent qualitative and quantitative outputs.

### Section S2: Microarchitecture of the ‘Prompt Auditor’
Details the ‘Auditor’ archetype, which implements echeloned quality control. It describes the multi-tiered verification pipeline, from the audit of the evidence base to final arbitration.

### Section S3: Microarchitecture of the ‘Prompt Communicator’
Describes the ‘Communicator’ archetype, outlining the multi-stage process for the ethical and didactic adaptation of the professional report for the end-user, including mechanisms for ensuring stylistic consistency and the dynamic generation of auxiliary materials.

### Section S4: Multi-Level Validation Protocol
Presents the formal, detailed plan for the future empirical verification of the system, including its psychometric (reliability, validity), didactic (pedagogical effectiveness), and bias audit components.

### Section S5: Epistemological and Ontological Foundations
Elaborates on the deeper philosophical grounding of the project in process-relational ontology (viewing traits as dynamic patterns) and critical fallibilism (viewing knowledge as the result of conjecture and refutation).

### Section S6: Full System Blueprint and Technical Specifications
Provides a formal reference and clarifies the scope of disclosure, committing to open science principles while distinguishing conceptual blueprints from implementation-specific assets.
